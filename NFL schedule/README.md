### This package has been designed to create the NFL schedule according to most of the rules actually used to create the real thing.

### Here are the rules:
- There are 18 weeks
    - each team has 1 bye week (must be from week 4 to 14)
- Each team plays 17 games
    - 6 games are within their division --> play the other 3 teams twice: 1 home, 1 away against each opponent
    - 4 games are against teams from a different division in the same conference (2 home, 2 away)
    - 4 games are against teams from a division in the other coference (2 home, 2 away)
    - 2 games against the rermaining teams in its own conference, based on division ranking from the previous season. 
    - 1 game against a non conference opponent from a division that the team is not scheduled to play


#### Long term constraints to implement later:
- Every team plays each of the other 31 teams at least once every 4 years
- Last year's Super Bowl champion plays at home for the week 1 Thursday night game that kicks off the new season.
- International games
