things to keep track of

for each division:
1) in_conf divisional matchups
2) the other 2 i_conf divisions to play
3) x_conf divisional matchups

for each team
1) who they need to play
2) when they need to play each type of game
3) pair up the type of game with who they play, 
    - for conf-divisional games, ensure identical matchups dont happen in back-to-back weeks


at league level, keep a dictionary of all teams:
    w/ levels -> conference: division: team




league

conference

division

team


Bengals 2023:

BYE WEEK
-> 7

DIVISIONAL:
A.n -> [1, 2, 11, 12, 16, 18]

SAME CONFERENCE DIFFERENT DIVISION (4 games):
A.s -> [4 (titans), 10 (texans), 13 (jaguars), 14 (colts)]

SAME CONFERENCE, 1 team from each of the 2 divisions you havent faced yet:
A.e -> 9 (bills)
A.w -> 17 (chiefs)

OTHER CONFERENCE ANY 1 DIVISION (4 games):
N.w -> [3 (rams), 5 (cardinals), 6 (seahawks), 8 (49ers)]

OTHER CONFERENCE, 1 random team from any of the other 3 DIVs (ideally chosen with similar division rank from last season)
N.n -> 15 (vikings)



within each conference:
look at each team
while that team has len(self.opponents) < 16:
- find 1 team in each of the 2 conferences who they havent played yet.
- can do this by randomly selecting from all teams in conference, then checking if that team is in self.opponents
    - if already played, select another team
